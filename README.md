# UiPath Linq

* LINQ stands for Language-Integrated Query and enables you to query data simply and powerfully. 
* LINQ is commonly used to query arrays, data tables, dictionaries, lists, and XML using C# or VB.Net. 
* The LINQ functionality can be achieved by importing System.Linq namespace in our applications.

For all the queries list below we use below datatable names
